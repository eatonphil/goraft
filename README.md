# goraft

A minimal implementation of Raft in Go. [Demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIR8RoN2LDU).

This blog post [walks through the code](https://notes.eatonphil.com/2023-05-25-raft.html).

NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE.

Things that are missing:

* Client serial identifier for each message (maybe the most obvious missing function/actual bug)
  * Search for "session" in [Diego Ongaro's thesis](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/OngaroPhD.pdf) for more details.
* Snapshotting/checkpointing and associated state transfer
* Configuration change protocol
* Rigged up to Jepsen
* Surely much else

## Stress

Not particularly aggressive yet but does basic correctness and stress
testing.

Read more about the details of what it tests [in the
README](./cmd/stress/README.md).

```console
$ cd cmd/stress
$ go run main.go util.go
```

With the `go-deadlock` package turned off and the default `sync`
package on, I get throughput of around 20k-40k entries/second with
this stress test.

# Distributed Key-Value Store API

Try out the builtin distributed key-value API.

```console
$ cd cmd/kvapi && go build
$ rm *.dat
```

## Terminal 1

```console
$ ./kvapi --node 0 --http :2020 --cluster "1,:3031;2,:3032;3,:3033"
```

## Terminal 2

```console
$ ./kvapi --node 1 --http :2021 --cluster "1,:3031;2,:3032;3,:3033"
```

## Terminal 3

```console
$ ./kvapi --node 2 --http :2022 --cluster "1,:3031;2,:3032;3,:3033"
```

## Terminal 4

Remember that requests will go through the leader (except for if we
turn that off in the `/get` request). So you'll have to try sending a
message to each server until you find the leader.

To set a key:

```console
$ curl http://localhost:2020/set?key=y&value=hello
```

To get a key:

```console
$ curl http://localhost:2020/get\?key\=y
```
